    <h1>Mapping Los Angeles Musical Venues</h1>
    <h2>Official (red) and unofficial (blue) venues that students in MUSIC 285 placed in LA</h2>
    <h3>By Joey Rose</h3>
    <p>The authors went to great lengths to expose themselves to musical scenes of all genres, historical backgrounds, location, and types. Furthermore, they extensively interviewed countless artists who have played in venues all across the city.

In terms of approach for the paper, the authors provide brief overviews of canonical narratives that highlight the 'three graces' of Liverpool's musical heritage, only to provide counterarguments to them right after. This methodology allows them to focus on the shortcomings of such narratives, which helps the authors move past them.</p>
